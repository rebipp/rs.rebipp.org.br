title: REBIPP Plant-Pollinator Interactions Standard
summary: Plant-Pollinator Interactions is a standard maintained by the [REBIPP maintenance group](../../community/ppi). It includes a glossary of terms intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about biological interactions**, especially plant-pollinator interactions, by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. PPI is based on [Darwin Core](https://www.tdwg.org/dwc).
